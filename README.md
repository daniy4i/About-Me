## Featured Projects
A selection of my analytics and SQL-based projects focused on insight generation, optimization, and trend analysis.

### Intel Sustainability Impact Analysis
- Assessed over **600,000 device records** to measure lifecycle CO₂ and energy savings through repurposing initiatives.  
- Designed SQL queries integrating `JOIN`, `CASE`, and aggregate functions to calculate carbon reduction and power savings.  
- Identified **6,700+ tons of CO₂** and **25.7 kWh per device annual energy savings**, informing Intel’s sustainability strategy.  
- **Tools:** SQL, PostgreSQL, Data Aggregation, Environmental Analytics  

### GameJet Transactions Analysis
- Examined **22,000+ user transactions** to classify player personas and identify monetization patterns.  
- Conducted behavioral segmentation (Free, Minnow, Dolphin, Whale) and linked engagement metrics to transaction frequency.  
- Discovered that less than **10 % of users generate most of the platform’s revenue**, guiding pricing and reward strategy.  
- **Tools:** SQL, Data Modeling, Behavioral Analytics  

### FastKitchen Customer Analysis
- Processed **50,000+ customer orders** to identify high-value clients and purchasing behavior trends.

- **Tools:** SQL, Crunchbase Dataset, Financial Analytics  

### YouTube Trending Analysis
- Examined **6,351 trending videos** using SQL to determine engagement drivers behind viral content.  
- Ranked categories by viewer interaction (likes, comments, shares) and measured regional audience trends.  
- Correlated engagement ratios with daily ranking persistence to predict trend longevity.  
- **Tools:** SQL, Data Visualization, Media Analytics  

### London Transit Analysis
- Modeled **commuter flow across London Underground zones** to assess congestion and efficiency.  
- Leveraged SQL to compute average trip duration and station throughput by time segments.  
- Delivered findings that supported route scheduling and demand balancing.  
- **Tools:** SQL, Transportation Analytics, Data Modeling  

### Traffic Collisions in California
- Processed **940,000+ collision records** to identify top contributing factors such as weather, visibility, and alcohol use.
